# Piscine.OCaml.d03

The day03 is focused on trees (bstree, avltree, binary tree) and
compilation methods.

We implement binary tree, binary search tree and AVL-trees. We are free to use
how we want to build our executables: Makefile (with or without
[https://github.com/mmottl/ocaml-makefile](OCamlMakefile), ocamlfind. We can
choose which compilers (ocamlc or ocamlopt) we want to use.

We learn how to use C-binded library, modules, file types and command line
arguments (argv).

OPAM is also introduce and we learn basics about merlin and ocp-indent.
